# 📰 Security Now! #1034 – Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs  
*15 July 2025*

## 🔬 1. Quantum factorization — hype vs reality  
Steve debunks popular claims that quantum computers are close to factoring RSA‑2048 — he argues these reports are premature and based on optimistic extrapolations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🛡️ 2. Notepad++ signs its own certificate  
Notepad++ has started code-signing its own builds using an in‑house certificate. While it improves integrity, it lacks the assurance of third‑party validation and presents possible trust issues. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🏦 3. Crypto‑ATM machines outlawed  
U.S. lawmakers have banned standalone crypto‑ATM machines to prevent money laundering and unregulated currency conversion. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🔐 4. Signal vs WhatsApp – encryption in flight & at rest  
Steve compares Signal and WhatsApp security, notably that Signal never stores messages on servers, while WhatsApp retains encrypted backups — presenting differing risk models. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 👁️ 5. Browser fingerprinting metrics  
A new study shows how browsers can be fingerprinted using many data points: fonts, canvas, time zone, etc., enabling tracking even without cookies. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 🛠️ 6. Rewriting interpreters in memory-safe languages  
Steve discusses efforts to rewrite languages and interpreters (like Python) in memory-safe languages (Rust, Go) to reduce security issues from memory corruption. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 🧩 7. **Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
- Steve introduces **ZK Proofs** (interactive and non‑interactive), where a prover (Peggy) convinces a verifier (Victor) that a statement is true **without revealing the statement itself**.  
- He explains the distinction between interactive protocols (multiple message exchanges) and non-interactive ones (single proof).  
- The concept is contextualized via analogies and simple puzzles, like proving age without showing an ID. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
